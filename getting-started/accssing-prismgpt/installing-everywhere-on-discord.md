To send a message using Discord's beta feature, type the following command anywhere in Discord:

```

Fantastic! We can now engage with PrismGPT directly without needing to add it into our servers.

PrismGPT's `/ask` feature is now available across Discord. However, for servers with more than 25 members, responses from PrismGPT will be private, visible only to the user who initiated the `/ask` command.
